I have analyzed data sets compiled from credit card transactions in India, which includes information about the credit card types used and their usage by state. By delving into this data, I have been able to identify the states that have the highest and lowest credit card usage rates. Moreover, my analysis has also uncovered which types of cards are predominantly used for high-value transactions, the gender that uses credit cards most often, and the most frequently utilized cards. Additionally, I have discovered which billing categories are most commonly utilized and which states have a low credit card usage rate. Furthermore, I have identified the state that has the highest fuel usage and the state with the lowest fuel usage. Lastly, my analysis has revealed which state has nearly 10 lakhs of credit card transactions and which state has more than 5 lakhs.
